# ASF-infra-scripts
A set of scripts for integrating to Apache Jenkins CI system

We split the associated projects into different directories. When some thing jobs/builds want to use these scripts, they will download the test script from here.

The current list of Apache Projects which use the scripts in this repo is:
apache/hadoop
apache/hbase
